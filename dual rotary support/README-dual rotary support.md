#Summary

Dual knob mount for radio management panels or Garmin autopilot panels. Designed for EC11 5 pin rotary encoders with round knob (parts grip by pressing on it).

Buttons on both encoders are not disabled, please note that the upper chassis (chassis2.stl) is 1mm thick on the button area, and either that panel should be replaced by your top cover, or you need to enlarge engranaje2.stl and tubofino.stl according to the added width if you mount the cover on top of it.

If you dont want to use the buttons, ignore the one on the mount and fill the hole for the small dedicated one. Dont remove the chassis2 spacers, they provide junction stability.

Youll need also:

* 16mm spacers: x4
* M3 screws: x8
* M3 nuts: x4
* M3 washers: x4 (on top of chassis.stl)
* EC11 rotary encoders: x2

#Notes

I used PLA from Amazon seller Geeetech. Try to keep the friction faces on your printer bed so they come up extra smooth (except tubofino.stl as you can avoid lots of supports and result is fine enough).

#Post-Printing Tips

Some sanding might be needed on the button hole at chassis2.stl.

If you dont want to use the buttons, ignore the one on the mount and fill the hole for the small dedicated one. Dont remove the chassis2 spacers, they provide junction stability. Washers or tiny spacers needed to increase chassis separation by ~0.5mm, as it improves touch feeling.
